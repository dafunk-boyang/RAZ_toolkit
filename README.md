Current usable applications are the SKills accuracy output and the weekly reading output.

Skills accuracy goes to each student's skills page over the time period of 30 days, and calculates the weighted average over each of the skills that they answered questions in. This overall average is then output alongside the name of the student in a csv file. The header for the accuracy column is the data that the data was collected for the convenience of the user.

Weekly reading simply automates the process of looking up the weekly activity report for a class. It outputs yes or no to whether students have completed 2 hours 20 minutes of interaction (reading, listening, quizzes, recordings), yes or no whether they have completed 3 recordings, and the remaining time to meet 2 hours 20 minutes.
